# From Chaos to Order - Using the Repository Pattern the Right Way

## Presentation Summary
If you've ever struggled with your data access being a mess, hard to follow, and even harder to test, perhaps using the tried and true Repository pattern might be the right choice for you!

In this beginner-friendly and code heavy session, we will break down the principles behind the repository pattern and how combining it with other patterns like Unit Of Work will make sure that you keep our data consistent, robust and testable.

In the end, we will dive into some code examples and have a working, basic implementation of a repository with the necessary plumbing for your next application.

## Speaker
- Eric Johansson, aka Thindal.

## The demo
The demo is a basically empty project, containing a few model classes and hard coded data sources.
From here, an application is built showing how the repository pattern can be used to safely and consistently access the data.
A quick demonstation of how to use the repository pattern to migrate from one datasource to another is also made.
